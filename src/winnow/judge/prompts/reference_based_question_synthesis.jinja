{#
    Template for reference-based question synthesis as described in the Themis LLM-as-a-Judge paper
    
    Variables:
    - scenario_name: The name of the specific scenario for which questions are being generated 
      (e.g., "Close QA", "Open QA", "Creative writing", etc.)
    - scenario_description: Brief description explaining what the scenario entails
    - reference_text: The text material that serves as the basis for generating questions
    - examples: List of example questions relevant to the scenario (at least 3 examples)
    
    This template implements the reference-based questioning approach from the paper,
    which leverages LLMs' generative ability to synthesize user instructions for specific scenarios
    based on reference texts. The structured output format ensures consistent question generation
    with appropriate difficulty levels.

Requirements for the scenario:
<scenario>
<name>{scenario_name}</name>
<definition>{scenario_description}</definition>
</scenario>

<reference_text>
{reference_text}
</reference_text>

<requirements>
1. The generated questions and answers should be based on the article content and should meet the scenario requirements.
2. Questions should be detailed, containing necessary information to encourage thorough answers.
3. If the information in the reference text is insufficient to generate question-answer pairs, return the following: "Sorry, this article does not contain enough information related to {scenario_name} to generate relevant questions and answers."
4. The generated question-answer pairs need to simulate questions and answers people might consult the LLM about in real-life scenarios.
5. Ensure the completeness and answerability of the questions independently; include the original content if necessary.
6. Ensure the correctness of the answers.
</requirements>

<sample_questions>
<example_1>{examples[0]}</example_1>
<example_2>{examples[1]}</example_2>
<example_3>{examples[2]}</example_3>
</sample_questions>

Please generate 5 sets of question-answer pairs that meet the requirements:

<qa_pairs>
<qa_pair>
<question>[The generated question based on article content]</question>
<answer>[The answer to the question, if possible, based on article content; otherwise, based on model's own knowledge]</answer>
<level>[The difficulty level of the question: easy/medium/difficult]</level>
</qa_pair>
</qa_pairs>
