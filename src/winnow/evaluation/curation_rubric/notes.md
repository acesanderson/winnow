These are some deeply-considered rubric dimensions for Professional Certificate curations.

## Dimension 1: Topical Coverage & Relevance

**Focus:** How accurately, comprehensively, and relevantly does the curated set of courses represent the target skill domain, job role, or topic defined for the Professional Certificate?
**Why:** This is the absolute foundation. The primary job of the curation (especially an automated one) is to select content that actually matches the intended subject matter. It assesses whether the right knowledge areas are included and irrelevant ones are excluded. For automation, this dimension targets the core matching/selection accuracy.
**Evaluation looks at:** Alignment of course content/skills with the target domain definition, depth and breadth of coverage across essential sub-skills, avoidance of off-topic content.

## Dimension 2: Content Quality & Currency

**Focus:** What is the intrinsic quality and timeliness of the individual courses selected for the curation?
**Why:** Even if the topics are relevant, a curation built from low-quality, outdated, or poorly-rated courses will fail. This dimension evaluates the quality of the chosen building blocks. Automation needs to prioritize selecting effective and current content from the vast library.
**Evaluation looks at:** Course ratings, learner engagement data, instructor expertise/reputation, production quality (if assessable), and crucially, the age or last updated date of the courses relative to the subject matter's volatility.

## Dimension 3: Structural Cohesion & Learning Path

**Focus:** How well do the selected courses fit together to form a coherent and logical learning progression? Does the overall structure make sense as a curriculum?
**Why:** A Professional Certificate isn't just a random collection of relevant courses; it implies a structured path. This dimension assesses how well the curated list functions as a curriculum. It considers sequence, redundancy, total length, and flow. Automation needs to assemble the selected courses into a sensible package.
**Evaluation looks at:** Logical sequencing (e.g., foundational before advanced), minimal redundancy/overlap between courses, overall duration falling within the typical PC range (e.g., 4-10 hours), smooth transitions between course topics (if inferable).
